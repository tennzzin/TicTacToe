# Tic-Tac-Toe 

## Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a JavaScript/React-based implementation of the classic two-player game. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, and the game determines the winner by detecting a line of three matching symbols. It provides a user-friendly interface, highlights winning combinations, and allows players to review past moves.

## Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Two players alternate turns to play until there is a winner or a draw.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects and highlights the winning combination.
- **Draw Handling**: Declares a draw when all squares are filled without a winner.
- **Interactive UI**: React-powered interface with responsive buttons for player moves.
- **Game History**: Allows players to revisit previous moves during the game.
